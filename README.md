# KalmanFIlterLocalizationROS2

Implementation and testing of Kalman Filter

Using IMU and encoders and Bag file with recorded data of TurtleBot3 travelling a Predefined path

The Bag File contains the necessary topics including sensor measurements

The covariance matrices for the Kalman Filter were appropriately chosen

Used tf as ground truth and computed MSE
